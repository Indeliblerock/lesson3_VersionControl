            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system that allows the transfer of files from a local repository to a remote repository.  Git has three main stages to work with. The first stage is the working copy; it is where the code is written and edited. The second stage is the staging area; this is where the code is updated to become a new version. The last stage is the git directory; this stage is where the information from the local repository is transferred to the remote repository. We will be using GitHub in this assignment, and in several other assignments. It is important to know what git is before we can even imagine using it.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three primary commands that we need to know to work with git. These would be git add, git commit, and git push. Git add is used to select the files that are to be prepared to change the repository. Git commit is used to create an update to the repository. Git push is used to bring the changes from the local repository to the remote repository. Knowing these three commands is essential to understanding how to use a version control system such as git. Most of our assignments from this assignment on will require us to move our files to a remote repository. This means we need to know how to use git to move these files.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is a file system that is stored on a local computer. It is primarily used to write, edit, and test code. The local repository will be where all code is edited, but it is not the final copy. The final copy is sent to the remote repository. Other developers can take code from the remote repository and bring it into their local repository to edit the code. As an Information Technology major, it is helpful to understand that the local repository is where most of our work will be done. In our personal or work life, it is likely that we will be using a local repository to write and edit the code of the projects we work on.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository is a file system that is stored on a server separate from your computer. It can be used to showcase a project to other developers or to share code. As most changes in programs occur in the local repository, the remote repository is often not used for the modifying of code. It is a good location to access code to collaborate on other projects. It is helpful to know the difference between the local and remote repository as an Information Technology major; the use of the remote repository will be used to put forth our work whether in personal or work life. This assignment will be using a remote repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system is a system that maintains prior changes within the program that is being worked on. This system can make the process of file sharing easier by using a common repository. This system does not overwrite any files and it saves prior versions of the program. These systems are commonly used when working in projects that include programming. As an Information Technology major, it is a good idea to be aware of how these systems work. Without these systems, we can lose files if a problem occurs, so we should do our best to maintain this necessary information by using these systems.</p>
